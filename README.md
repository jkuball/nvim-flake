This is my neovim configuration as a flake, configured via [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim).

I am advising you to not use this and not take this as a template.
It is opinioated and built by me, for me.

Also, it is not really that complex. Just some things I want.
It is mostly nix because I can bundle some language servers in a reasonable manner.
